# POSTMAN

#### _What is Postman and what is it for?_

Postman is a Google Chrome browser extension that allows the sending of HTTP REST requests without the need to develop a client. Once Postman is installed, it is necessary to open it and install the Postman Jetpack plugin in order to create the tests and launch them together.

In this folder we will have the content to send request to postman.
